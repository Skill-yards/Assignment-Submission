Ans-1- Let-it is a block scope variable and it can be reassigned or can be re declared
       var-it is a globally scoped variable that is in use until let came and its also can be reassigned and redeclared.
       const- it is a block scope variable in which we store the values that are constant throughout the code and it cannot be       redeclared or reassigned.

Ans-2-if we dont have to use template literals then we use (+) sign to join two strings or Strings and no.s or any data types.
       example-
       let name = 'chakresh';
       let age = 23;
       isStudent = true;
       console.log('Student name is ' + name +' age is '+ age +' and is Student '+ isStudent)    
       output: Student name is chakresh age is 23 and is Student true

Ans-3-It gives an Error that the value stored in const should be constant and cannot be reassigned.
